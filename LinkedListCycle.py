# Example 1:
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

# Example 3:
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
